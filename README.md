# What are containers?
- To understand what container security is, you must know what exactly a container is.

- Container is a package of software and its dependencies.
- Example: Think of a software container like a shipping container
- The container holds everything for the item inside
- - The application itself
  - Runtime (e.f., .NET, Node.js)
  - Libraries and dependencies
  - Config files
- The container runs the same way everywhere
- - on a developer's laptop
    In test environments
    in production (cloud or on-prem)

Software container is like a shipping container
- It doesn't care what truck or ship it's on (Linux VM, cloud service, kubernetes).
- It GUARANTEES the contents arrive unchanged and predictable.



# What do organizations use Container? 
1. Consistency
- It provides consistency and solves the issue of "Well, it works on my machine"
  
2. Faster deployments
- Container start in seconds
- Easy to deploy, roll back, and scale

3. Better resource efficiency
- Much lighter than full virtual machines
- Containers share the host OS kernel

4. Scalability
- Easy to run multiple copies of an app when demand increases
- Works well with orchestrator like Kubernetes

5. Isolation and Security
- Each app runs in its own isolated environment
- Reduces blast radius compared to shared runtimes

Common Container platforms
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Azure Kubernetes Service
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Container Instances
